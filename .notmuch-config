# .notmuch-config - Configuration file for the notmuch mail system
#
# For more information about notmuch, see https://notmuchmail.org

# Database configuration
#
# The only value supported here is 'path' which should be the top-level
# directory where your mail currently exists and to where mail will be
# delivered in the future. Files should be individual email messages.
# Notmuch will store its database within a sub-directory of the path
# configured here named ".notmuch".
#
[database]
path=/Users/jindraj/.mail/gmail

# User configuration
#
# Here is where you can let notmuch know how you would like to be
# addressed. Valid settings are
#
#	name		Your full name.
#	primary_email	Your primary email address.
#	other_email	A list (separated by ';') of other email addresses
#			at which you receive email.
#
# Notmuch will use the various email addresses configured here when
# formatting replies. It will avoid including your own addresses in the
# recipient list of replies, and will set the From address based on the
# address to which the original email was addressed.

# Configuration for "notmuch new"
#
# The following options are supported here:
#
#	tags	A list (separated by ';') of the tags that will be
#		added to all messages incorporated by "notmuch new".
#
#	ignore	A list (separated by ';') of file and directory names
#		that will not be searched for messages by "notmuch new".
#
#		NOTE: *Every* file/directory that goes by one of those
#		names will be ignored, independent of its depth/location
#		in the mail store.
#

ignore=*.json;*.bak;.lock

#
# The following option is supported here:
#
#	exclude_tags
#		A ;-separated list of tags that will be excluded from
#		search results by default.  Using an excluded tag in a
#		query will override that exclusion.
#

# Maildir compatibility configuration
#
# The following option is supported here:
#
#	synchronize_flags      Valid values are true and false.
#
#	If true, then the following maildir flags (in message filenames)
#	will be synchronized with the corresponding notmuch tags:
#
#		Flag	Tag
#		----	-------
#		D	draft
#		F	flagged
#		P	passed
#		R	replied
#		S	unread (added when 'S' flag is not present)
#
#	The "notmuch new" command will notice flag changes in filenames
#	and update tags, while the "notmuch tag" and "notmuch restore"
#	commands will notice tag changes and update flags in filenames
